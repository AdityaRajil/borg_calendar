To build Simple BORG from the source, you need the JAVA SDK 1.5 or later, available from java.sun.com.

As of release 1.6.1 of BORG, the product consists of a single Eclipse Project - BORGCalendar

The ant build file to build the entire thing is in the ant folder.

Building
--------
Simple BORG is built using ant. If you have ant (available at apache.org), then
from command line in the BORGCalendar/ant folder, you can do "ant" to run the default target.

Eclipse
-------
BORG development is done using the Eclipse IDE. 

To use eclipse, the BORGCalendar project folder can be imported as a project into eclipse.
To build, you can set up an Ant Build task under the eclipse exteral tools. 

You should be able to use the eclipse debugger to debug the code. You should be able to run the main
Borg class (Borg Calendar UI/src/net/sf.borg.control.Borg) from within eclipse. 

Most GUI screens were originally created via the Netbeans or Eclipse visual editors. You do not need to use this to edit the GUI screens,
and I recommend that you don't. The Eclipse visual editor seems to make a mess of the code more often than not - so I am no
longer making an effort to use it.

NetBeans
--------
Netbeans is not used anymore. I would not suggest using it for BORG.
