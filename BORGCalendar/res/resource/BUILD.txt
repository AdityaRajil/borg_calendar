To build BORG from the source, you need the JAVA SDK 1.4 or later, available from java.sun.com.

As of release 1.6.1 of BORG, the product consists of the following eclipse projects:

- BORGCalendar
- BORGPalmConduits
- BORGServlet


The ant build file to build the entire thing is in the ant folder in the BORGCalendar sub-project.

Building
--------
BORG is built using ant. If you have ant (available at apache.org), then
from command line in the BORGCalendar/ant folder, you can do "ant fulldist".
Below are the various ant targets that might be useful:

- ant fulldist - This will build the BORG jar and zip files in the BORGCalendar/dist directory. 
borg.zip can be unzipped and borg.jar can be run. 
**** Running this target alone is sufficient to build the program. ****
Most people will want to use this target.

- ant installer - This will create the IzPack installers for BORG in the Common/dist folder.
This target builds all 3 projects. 
The IzPack software is required (http://www.izforge.com/izpack) and the build.xml file must be
updated with the path to this software. The BORGPalmConduits project requires the Palm JSync package,
so the installer option is only for those people who really want to download the necessary third-party software
(JSync, IZPack, JavaHelp) in order to build the whole big mess.

- ant regen-help - this will generate the search database for the online help. You only need to do this
if you want to generate the search database. Without this step, the help will be readable, but not searchable.
You need to install JavaHelp (http://java.sun.com/products/javahelp/) and modify the build.xml file with the JavaHelp
path. This target is not executed as part of the fulldist target as it requires the optional JavaHelp package.

Eclipse
-------
BORG development is done using the Eclipse IDE. 

To use eclipse, each of the top 3 project folders can be imported as projects into eclipse.
The .project and .classpath files that configure eclipse are part of the source tree and should get the 3 projects
all set up correctly. To build, you can set up an Ant Build task under the eclipse exteral
tools. 

Most people will not care about the BORGPalmConduits and BORGServlet projects. You can close these or just not import them if you like.

You should be able to use the eclipse debugger to debug the code. You should be able to run the main
Borg class (Borg Calendar UI/src/net/sf.borg.control.Borg) from within eclipse. 

Most GUI screens were originally created via the Netbeans or Eclipse visual editors. You do not need to use this to edit the GUI screens,
and I recommend that you don't. The Eclipse visual editor seems to make a mess of the code more often than not - so I am no
longer making an effort to use it.

NetBeans
--------
Netbeans is not used anymore. I would not suggest using it for BORG.
