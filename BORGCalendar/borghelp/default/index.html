<H1>The BORG Calendar and Task Tracker HELP</H1>
<HR SIZE=2>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><FONT FACE="Arial">This Help system does not
list every single feature of BORG. Anything that BORG does that is
not listed here is either something obvious, or something that is
mistakenly missing. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><FONT FACE="Arial">BORG has 4 main parts:</FONT></P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Calendar, which manages appointments
	and “to do” items.</FONT> 
	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Task Tracker, which manages complex
	tasks.</FONT> 
	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Address Book</FONT> 
	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial">Memos</FONT> 
	</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><FONT FACE="Arial">There is a vast difference
between a “to do” and a Task, and between the “to do”
functionality of the calendar versus the Task Tracker. A “to do”
is simply a calendar event that also will show up on a list of things
to do in addition to appearing in the calendar. When the user marks
an item on the to do list as done, it is removed from the list.
That’s all that you do with to do’s, you mark them as done.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><FONT FACE="Arial">A Task is quite different.
The Task Tracker functionality actually grew out of the need to track
software development tasks and has more in common with a software
enhancement/bug tracking system than a calendar. The task tracker can
track different tasks through user tunable states. The task types
included with BORG by default include tasks to represent code
development, document development, a generic task, and a generic
issue (i.e. item that needs an answer). These task types and states
can be customized. For example, the author of this program has a
“Borg Release” task type that contains the associated states and
sub-tasks involved in producing and releasing this program.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><FONT FACE="Arial">The Address book and Memo
parts of BORG were developed to replace the functionality of the Palm
desktop address book and memo applications so that Palm users could
eliminate the need to use the Palm desktop. As of release 1.7.2, the
Palm sync functionality is no longer supported, but the address and
memo features remain.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><FONT FACE="Arial">Please refer to specific help
sections for more information about the program.</FONT></P>
