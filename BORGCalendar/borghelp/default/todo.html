<P CLASS="msonormal"><FONT FACE="Arial">The To Do list is accessed
from the <I><B>Action/To Do</B></I> menu choice from the main Month
screen. It also pops up upon start up. This list shows all
appointments marked as To Do's that have not been marked as done. To
Do's can be marked as done from the To Do window menu. There are 2
options to pick from when marking To Do's as done. The <I><B>Done (No
Delete)</B></I> menu option, removes the appointment from the To Do
list, but leaves it on the calendar. The <I><B>Done (Delete)</B></I>
option removes it from the calendar also (unless the todo has more
repeats, in which case the next occurrence is shown on the to do
list).<BR><BR>The To Do list can also be printed using its
<I><B>Action/Print List</B></I> menu choice.</FONT></P>
