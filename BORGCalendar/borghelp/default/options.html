	will be populated only with the installed look and feels in your
	JRE. Some of the L&amp;Fs from Java are not so appealing with BORG.
	The PlasticXP look and feel is distributed with BORG to make sure
	you have at least one good looking one. If you change the look and
	feel, restart BORG to have it take effect.</FONT></P>

	the range of times shown on both the Week and Day View grids. </FONT>

	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Holidays - Most US and
	Canadian holidays can be shown (optionally). Except for Christmas,
	religious/ethnic holidays are not included - mainly because they are
	usually lunar based and harder to calculate - and because they
	aren't usually a day off from work. These can be added manually
	through the appointment editor. </FONT>

	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Truncate Appointments in Month
	View – this is set by default and causes only the first line of

	multi-line appointments to show in the month view, shut this feature
	off. </FONT>

Change</FONT> will change the BORG database location and exit the
program. The new location takes effect when the program is restarted.
No data is copied and the original database is not removed. If you
just want to move or copy db files to a new location – just copy
them and change to the new location from the options screen. </FONT>

	copy will just open the running copy and exit. </FONT>
