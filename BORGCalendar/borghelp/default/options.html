older systems, the options screen does not appear instantly (like
other screens). A delay is normal and is caused by the lookup (by the
Java runtime) of the list of “Look and Feels” installed on the
system.</FONT></P>

	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Look And Feel - the combo box
	will be populated only with the installed look and feels in your JRE
	and also the Jgoodies look and feels from jgoodies.com. Some of the
	L&amp;Fs from Java are not so appealing with BORG. The PlasticXP
	look and feel is distributed with BORG to make sure you have at
	least one good looking one. If you change the look and feel, restart
	BORG to have it take effect.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Week View Start and End Hour –
	the range of times shown on both the Week and Day View grids. </FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Holidays - Most US and
	Canadian holidays can be shown (optionally). Except for Christmas,
	religious/ethnic holidays are not yet included - mainly because they
	are usually lunar based and much harder to calculate - and because
	they aren't usually a day off from work. These can be added manually
	through the appointment editor. </FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Truncate Appointments in Month
	View – this is set by default and causes only the first line of
	appointment text to show in the month view. If you want all lines of
	multi-line appointments to show in the month view, shut this feature
	off. </FONT>

Change</FONT> will restart BORG with the new Database. No data is
copied and the original database is not removed. If you just want to
move or copy db files to a new location – just copy them and change
to the new location from the options screen. </FONT>

	an error occurs and this option is set, a button will appear with
	the error screen to generate a stack trace. This can be used for
	debugging the error and can be sent to the developers. This need not
	be turned on unless debugging is being done.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Socket Port – setting a
	value here, (2929 is the default), will allow the program to detect
	when another copy is running. If you start a second copy of BORG
	when one is already running, and the socket port is set, the second
	copy will just open the running copy and exit. </FONT>
