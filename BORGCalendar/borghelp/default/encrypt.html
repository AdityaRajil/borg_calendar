<H2><FONT FACE="Arial">Encryption</FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Borg supports the optional encryption of Memos.
Encryption can be chosen on a per-memo basis. When chosen, AES
symmetric encryption is used to encrypt and decrypt memo text before
storing in the database. This encryption is meant to be secure enough
to protect any sensitive information.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Memos can be encrypted by checking the Encrypt
on Save check box before saving and then supplying the encryption
password when prompted. Encrypted memos can only be viewed by
pressing the decrypt button and supplying the password. The password
is the same for all memos (see below). </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">For maximum security, the password is never
stored by Borg. It must be re-entered before every encryption or
decryption operation. Also, memos that have been decrypted for
viewing will be re-locked as soon as the user saves the memo or
navigates to another memo.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Borg uses a single key for all encryption. It
is kept in a Java JCEKS Key Store file and is protected by a
user-chosen password. Encryption cannot be used unless this file is
set in the Borg Encryption Options. To create an initial Key Store,
go to the Encryption Options tab and browse to create a new file.
Borg will prompt for a password and then create the Key Store with a
new random key.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Key Store file contains the encryption key
and is protected by the password that is entered when the file is
created. Whenever Borg needs to encrypt or decrypt data, it will
prompt for this password. Do not forget this password. If lost, there
is no way to recover it and any encrypted data can no longer be
decrypted.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Likewise, do not lose the Key Store file and
keep safe backup copies. If you keep the Borg database on removable
media, such as a thumb drive, and mount it on different machines, you
will not be able to decrypt secure data unless the key store file is
also available to each machine and set in the options. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">For maximum security, the Key Store file should
be kept separate from the database. A malicious person that gets a
copy of your Borg database and/or your saved XML exports will not be
able to decrypt your protected data without the Key Store file. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Even with the Key Store file, a malicious
person will still not be able to decrypt Borg data without knowing
the password that was used to protect the Key Store.</FONT></P>
