RUNNING
-------
For Windows: The installer can create shortcuts in the start menu and 
desktop (optional)
   Otherwise, double-click borg.jar from windows explorer.
   It is found in the install folder that you choose from the installer.

Command Line (any OS): The quickest way to run BORG from a command line 
is: java -jar borg.jar
   This will work as long as the java executable from the JRE is in your PATH
   on whatever OS you are running.
