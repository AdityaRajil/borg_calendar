DATABASE CHANGES
----------------

IMPORTANT: if you are running BORG 1.5.2.1 or earlier, export your database to XML files BEFORE installing 1.6.
There are significant database changes in BORG 1.6. Scripts to upgrade from 1.5.2 are not available. 
Upgrade must be through XML Export/Import.

In general, the upgrade procedure is: 

1. Use BORG 1.5.x to export your DB to XML
2. Install BORG 1.6. You might want to not overwrite BORG 1.5.2 to keep both versions around
until you know that your db is upgraded properly.
3. Create a new, empty  1.6 database.
4. Import your db XML into BORG 1.6.

Details Follow:

Upgrade for HSQLDB users
----------------------------------

1. Backup your database files
2. From BORG 1.5.x, Export your database to XML files via the Import/Export menu option
3. Install BORG 1.6
4. Run BORG 1.6 and change BORG to use a new folder for its database. Restart BORG to create a
   new 1.6 database in this new folder.
5. From BORG 1.6, Import your database data from the XML files (borg.xml, mrdb.xml, addr.xml).

Upgrade for MySQL users
----------------------------------

1. Backup your database
2. From BORG 1.5.x, Export your database to XML files via the Import/Export menu option
3. Create a new database using the borg_mysql.sql SQL.
4. Run BORG 1.6 and set it to use the new, empty 1.6 database
4. From BORG 1.6, Import your database data from the XML files (borg.xml, mrdb.xml, addr.xml).

Upgrade for Local Files Users
-----------------------------
It is recommended, but not required that all Local Files users switch to HSQLDB. The Local Files will still work in BORG
1.6, but the new task tracker features (projects, subtasks) and the new memos features will not
work with Local Files. Local Files Users not upgrading to HSQLDB do not have any special upgrade procedures.

1. Backup your database files
2. From BORG 1.5.x, Export your database to XML files via the Import/Export menu option
3. Install BORG 1.6
4. Run BORG 1.6 and change BORG to use an HSQLDB database in a new folder. Restart BORG to create a
   new 1.6 HSQLDB database in this new folder.
5. From BORG 1.6, Import your database data from the XML files (borg.xml, mrdb.xml, addr.xml).

Upgrade for Remote Server Users
-------------------------------
As of Release 1.6, the remote server supports all of the new task tracking features

1. Backup your database
2. From BORG 1.5.x, Export your database to XML files via the Import/Export menu option
3. Create a new database using the borg_mysql.sql SQL.
4. Run BORG 1.6 and set it to use the new, empty 1.6 database. This means installing and configuring the remote
server web application to point to the new DB. Both the web application and java client need to be upgraded.
5. From BORG 1.6, Import your database data from the XML files (borg.xml, mrdb.xml, addr.xml).

REPORTS
-------
In order to get reporting functionality, the reports libraries must be downloaded separately.
This is a separate download since the report libraries would make the installer over 3MB larger.
The limited amount of reporting available in version 1.6 does not justify adding the extra
3MB to the installer at this time.


KNOWN ISSUES:
-------------

1. There are many new text strings that have not been translated. 
Feel free to mail any translations to i_flem@users.sourceforge.net.
There is nobody on the project actively updating the translations. Any
received translations will be posted as patches.

2. MySQL and HSQLDB users must migrate to a new database schema via Import/Export

3. The new Subtask features of the task tracker are not available for users of the local db files.
All users are encouraged to switch to MySQL or HSQLDB.

4. The Task Priority field is an integer (1-5) in BORG 1.6. Values from an old database that are not
   an integer between 1 and 5 will be converted to 3.

RUNNING
-------
For Windows: The installer can create shortcuts in the start menu and 
desktop (optional)
   Otherwise, double-click borg.jar from windows explorer.
   It is found in the install folder that you choose from the installer.

Command Line (any OS): The quickest way to run BORG from a command line 
is: java -jar borg.jar
   This will work as long as the java executable from the JRE is in your PATH
   on whatever OS you are running.
