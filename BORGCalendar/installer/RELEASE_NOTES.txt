RELEASE NOTES for SimpleBORG 1.7
==================================

The project home page is http://borg-calendar.sourceforge.net


REPORTS
-------
In order to get reporting functionality, the reports libraries must be downloaded separately.
This is a separate download since the report libraries would make the installer over 3MB larger.
The limited amount of reporting available does not justify adding the extra
3MB to the installer at this time.


KNOWN ISSUES:
-------------

1. There are always new text strings that have not been translated. 
Feel free to mail any translations to i_flem@users.sourceforge.net.
There is nobody on the project actively updating the translations. Any
received translations will be posted as patches.


RUNNING
-------
For Windows: The installer can create shortcuts in the start menu and 
desktop (optional)
   Otherwise, double-click borg.jar from windows explorer.
   It is found in the install folder that you choose from the installer.

Command Line (any OS): The quickest way to run BORG from a command line 
is: java -jar borg.jar
   This will work as long as the java executable from the JRE is in your PATH
   on whatever OS you are running. 


LICENSE
-------
BORG is open source under the GPL. A copy of the GPL is included with it.
