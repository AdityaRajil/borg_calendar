==================================
RELEASE NOTES for BORG 1.7.5
==================================

The project home page is http://borg-calendar.sourceforge.net

Noticeable Changes:
-------------------
The global option to dock/undock windows has been removed in 1.7.5. Now, almost
all windows can be docked or undocked and their docking state will be remembered when
the program restarts. The main Month view will not be undockable and will always be tied 
to the main program window.

The options for controlling shutdown/backup behavior have been enhanced. Please see the Shutdown 
option on the Miscellaneous Options tab for more info.

A properly working .exe installer is available for Windows-7.

Added better support for importing/export full ZIP backups.

Added H2 Database Support

Known Issues:
-------------
There are always new text strings that have not been translated. 
Feel free to mail any translations to i_flem@users.sourceforge.net.
There is nobody on the project actively updating the translations. Any
received translations will be posted as patches and then included in
the next release.


RUNNING
-------
For Windows: The installer can create shortcuts in the start menu and 
desktop (optional)
   Otherwise, double-click borg.jar from windows explorer.
   It is found in the install folder that you choose from the installer.
   
For Unix/Linux: Run the run_borg.sh script in the installation directory

Command Line (any OS): The quickest way to run BORG from a command line 
is: java -jar borg.jar from the installation folder
   This will work as long as the java executable from the JRE is in your PATH
   on whatever OS you are running.
