==================================
RELEASE NOTES for BORG 1.7.6
==================================

**** PLEASE READ: Release 1.7.6 has a few changes that may impact some users ****

Default Installation Folder
---------------------------
BORG's default installation folder will now be BORGCalendar (without a space between BORG and Calendar).
This change was needed as part of the fix to get Linux desktop shortcuts to properly work.
This fix will affect all platforms. Most users will not notice. Those few users that have custom start
scripts or have copied extra JARs under the "BORG Calendar" folder, will need to be aware that the name
has changed and that the installer will not just overwrite the existing "BORG Calendar" folder unless
you explicitly tell it to.

Dynamic Loading
---------------
Dynamic loading of JARs is now done for JARs in the lib/ext folder. Users that have put
JARs in the lib folder need to move them to the lib/ext folder for them to be loaded.
This change will keep the shipped JARs separate from any added JARs.

Most users are unaffected by this. Dynamically loaded JARs are only used to add additional look and feels,
extra database drivers (such as H2 or MySQL), and for adding the experimental BORG plugins.

-------------
There are always new text strings that have not been translated. 
Feel free to mail any translations to i_flem@users.sourceforge.net.
There is nobody on the project actively updating the translations. Any
received translations will be posted as patches and then included in
the next release.


RUNNING
-------
For Windows: The installer can create shortcuts in the start menu and 
desktop (optional)
   Otherwise, double-click borg.jar from windows explorer.
   It is found in the install folder that you choose from the installer.
   
For Unix/Linux: Run the run_borg.sh script in the installation directory

Command Line (any OS): The quickest way to run BORG from a command line 
is: java -jar borg.jar from the installation folder
   This will work as long as the java executable from the JRE is in your PATH
   on whatever OS you are running.
