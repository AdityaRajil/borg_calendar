REPORTS
-------
In order to get reporting functionality, the reports libraries must be downloaded separately.
This is a separate download since the report libraries would make the installer over 3MB larger.
The limited amount of reporting available does not justify adding the extra
3MB to the installer at this time.


KNOWN ISSUES:
-------------

1. There are always new text strings that have not been translated. 
Feel free to mail any translations to i_flem@users.sourceforge.net.
There is nobody on the project actively updating the translations. Any
received translations will be posted as patches.

2. *** IMPORTANT *** BORG 1.7.2 is not backward compatible with BORG 1.7.1 for appointments. Once you add
appointments in 1.7.2, you will not be able revert back to 1.7.1.

3. BORG 1.7.2 Eliminates some database fields and also changes the way appointments
are keyed in the database. A database conversion tool is available to remove the old fields
and renumber all appointments. This conversion is optional, and Borg 1.7.2 will run
with no problem against a 1.7.1 database. Users wanting to convert the data can
run: java -jar borg.jar -runtool ApptKeyConverter. 

4. *** IMPORTANT *** The XML Export and Import formats have changed in 1.7.2 in order to use JAX for export/import. 

RUNNING
-------
For Windows: The installer can create shortcuts in the start menu and 
desktop (optional)
   Otherwise, double-click borg.jar from windows explorer.
   It is found in the install folder that you choose from the installer.

Command Line (any OS): The quickest way to run BORG from a command line 
is: java -jar borg.jar
   This will work as long as the java executable from the JRE is in your PATH
   on whatever OS you are running.
