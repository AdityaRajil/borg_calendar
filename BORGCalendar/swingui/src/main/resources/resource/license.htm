GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<BR><BR>0. This License applies to any
program or other work which contains<BR>a notice placed by the
copyright holder saying it may be distributed<BR>under the terms of
this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below,<BR>refers
to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the
Program&quot;<BR>means either the Program or any derivative work
under copyright law:<BR>that is to say, a work containing the Program
or a portion of it,<BR>either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another<BR>language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in<BR>the term &quot;modification&quot;.)
Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<BR><BR>Activities
other than copying, distribution and modification are not<BR>covered
by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<BR>running
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<BR>is
covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<BR>Program
(independent of having been made by running the Program).<BR>Whether
that is true depends on what the Program does.<BR><BR>1. You may copy
and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<BR>source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you<BR>conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<BR>copyright notice
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<BR>notices that refer
to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<BR>and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<BR>along with
the Program.<BR><BR>You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy, and<BR>you may at your option offer warranty
protection in exchange for a fee.<BR><BR>2. You may modify your copy
or copies of the Program or any portion<BR>of it, thus forming a work
based on the Program, and copy and<BR>distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1<BR>above, provided that you also
meet all of these conditions:<BR><BR>a) You must cause the modified
files to carry prominent notices<BR>stating that you changed the
files and the date of any change.<BR><BR>b) You must cause any work
that you distribute or publish, that in<BR>whole or in part contains
or is derived from the Program or any<BR>part thereof, to be licensed
as a whole at no charge to all third<BR>parties under the terms of
this License.<BR><BR>c) If the modified program normally reads
commands interactively<BR>when run, you must cause it, when started
running for such<BR>interactive use in the most ordinary way, to
print or display an<BR>announcement including an appropriate
copyright notice and a<BR>notice that there is no warranty (or else,
saying that you provide<BR>a warranty) and that users may
redistribute the program under<BR>these conditions, and telling the
user how to view a copy of this<BR>License. (Exception: if the
Program itself is interactive but<BR>does not normally print such an
announcement, your work based on<BR>the Program is not required to
print an announcement.)<BR><BR>These requirements apply to the
modified work as a whole. If<BR>identifiable sections of that work
are not derived from the Program,<BR>and can be reasonably considered
independent and separate works in<BR>themselves, then this License,
and its terms, do not apply to those<BR>sections when you distribute
them as separate works. But when you<BR>distribute the same sections
as part of a whole which is a work based<BR>on the Program, the
distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<BR>this License,
whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<BR>entire whole,
and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<BR><BR>Thus,
it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<BR>your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is
to<BR>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative
or<BR>collective works based on the Program.<BR><BR>In addition, mere
aggregation of another work not based on the Program<BR>with the
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<BR>a
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work
under<BR>the scope of this License.<BR><BR>3. You may copy and
distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<BR>under Section 2) in
object code or executable form under the terms of<BR>Sections 1 and 2
above provided that you also do one of the following:<BR><BR>a)
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<BR>source
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<BR>1 and
2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
or,<BR><BR>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least
three<BR>years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than
your<BR>cost of physically performing source distribution, a
complete<BR>machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code,
to be<BR>distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium<BR>customarily used for software interchange; or,<BR><BR>c)
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<BR>to
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is<BR>allowed
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<BR>received the
program in object code or executable form with such<BR>an offer, in
accord with Subsection b above.)<BR><BR>The source code for a work
means the preferred form of the work for<BR>making modifications to
it. For an executable work, complete source<BR>code means all the
source code for all modules it contains, plus any<BR>associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<BR>control
compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a<BR>special
exception, the source code distributed need not include<BR>anything
that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<BR>form)
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of
the<BR>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
component<BR>itself accompanies the executable.<BR><BR>If
distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<BR>access
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<BR>access
to copy the source code from the same place counts as<BR>distribution
of the source code, even though third parties are not<BR>compelled to
copy the source along with the object code.<BR><BR>4. You may not
copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<BR>except as
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt<BR>otherwise to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<BR>void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<BR>However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<BR>this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as
such<BR>parties remain in full compliance.<BR><BR>5. You are not
required to accept this License, since you have not<BR>signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<BR>distribute
the Program or its derivative works. These actions are<BR>prohibited
by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<BR>modifying
or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<BR>Program),
you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<BR>all its
terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<BR>the
Program or works based on it.<BR><BR>6. Each time you redistribute
the Program (or any work based on the<BR>Program), the recipient
automatically receives a license from the<BR>original licensor to
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<BR>these terms and
conditions. You may not impose any further<BR>restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<BR>You are not
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<BR>this
License.<BR><BR>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or
allegation of patent<BR>infringement or for any other reason (not
limited to patent issues),<BR>conditions are imposed on you (whether
by court order, agreement or<BR>otherwise) that contradict the
conditions of this License, they do not<BR>excuse you from the
conditions of this License. If you cannot<BR>distribute so as to
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>License and any
other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<BR>may not
distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent<BR>license
would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<BR>all
those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<BR>the
only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be
to<BR>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<BR><BR>If
any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under<BR>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to<BR>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
in other<BR>circumstances.<BR><BR>It is not the purpose of this
section to induce you to infringe any<BR>patents or other property
right claims or to contest validity of any<BR>such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the<BR>integrity of the
free software distribution system, which is<BR>implemented by public
license practices. Many people have made<BR>generous contributions to
the wide range of software distributed<BR>through that system in
reliance on consistent application of that<BR>system; it is up to the
author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<BR>to distribute
software through any other system and a licensee cannot<BR>impose
that choice.<BR><BR>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear
what is believed to<BR>be a consequence of the rest of this
License.<BR><BR>8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is
restricted in<BR>certain countries either by patents or by
copyrighted interfaces, the<BR>original copyright holder who places
the Program under this License<BR>may add an explicit geographical
distribution limitation excluding<BR>those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among<BR>countries not thus
excluded. In such case, this License incorporates<BR>the limitation
as if written in the body of this License.<BR><BR>9. The Free
Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<BR>of the
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will<BR>be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
to<BR>address new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>Each version is given
a distinguishing version number. If the Program<BR>specifies a
version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any<BR>later
version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions<BR>either of that version or of any later version
published by the Free<BR>Software Foundation. If the Program does not
specify a version number of<BR>this License, you may choose any
version ever published by the Free Software<BR>Foundation.<BR><BR>10.
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
free<BR>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write
to the author<BR>to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free<BR>Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes<BR>make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals<BR>of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and<BR>of promoting
the sharing and reuse of software generally.<BR><BR>NO WARRANTY<BR><BR>11.
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY<BR>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN<BR>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<BR>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<BR>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<BR>MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS<BR>TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
THE<BR>PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING,<BR>REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR><BR>12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS
REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<BR>WILL ANY
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR<BR>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO
YOU FOR DAMAGES,<BR>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<BR>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<BR>TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<BR>YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
OTHER<BR>PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE<BR>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<BR><BR>END OF TERMS
AND CONDITIONS<BR><BR>How to Apply These Terms to Your New
Programs<BR><BR>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be
of the greatest<BR>possible use to the public, the best way to
achieve this is to make it<BR>free software which everyone can
redistribute and change under these terms.<BR><BR>To do so, attach
the following notices to the program. It is safest<BR>to attach them
to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<BR>the
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is
found.<BR><BR>&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief
idea of what it does.&gt;<BR>Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of
author&gt;<BR><BR>This program is free software; you can redistribute
it and/or modify<BR>it under the terms of the GNU General Public
License as published by<BR>the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2 of the License, or<BR>(at your option) any later
version.<BR><BR>This program is distributed in the hope that it will
be useful,<BR>but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
warranty of<BR>MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
See the<BR>GNU General Public License for more details.<BR><BR>You
should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<BR>along
with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<BR>Foundation,
Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA<BR><BR><BR>Also
add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.<BR><BR>If the program is interactive, make it output a short
notice like this<BR>when it starts in an interactive
mode:<BR><BR>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of
author<BR>Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.<BR>This is free software, and you are welcome to
redistribute it<BR>under certain conditions; type `show c' for
details.<BR><BR>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c'
should show the appropriate<BR>parts of the General Public License.
Of course, the commands you use may<BR>be called something other than
`show w' and `show c'; they could even be<BR>mouse-clicks or menu
items--whatever suits your program.<BR><BR>You should also get your
employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<BR>school, if any, to
sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,
if<BR>necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:<BR><BR>Yoyodyne,
Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
program<BR>`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
James Hacker.<BR><BR>&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<BR>Ty
Coon, President of Vice<BR><BR>This General Public License does not
permit incorporating your program into<BR>proprietary programs. If
your program is a subroutine library, you may<BR>consider it more
useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<BR>library.
If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<BR>Public
License instead of this License.
