<u><b>Databases</b></u></p>
<p>Borg
will create an H2 database in a default location when started after
the first install. Most users should never alter the database
settings. Some users may want to alter the location of the database,
for example to be on a removable drive.</p>
<p>For those users that want to change the default
settings, the available choices are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>HSQLDB</p>
	<li><p>H2</p>
	<li><p>Generic JDBC</p>
</ul>
<p>Borg has code to
explicitly support Sqlite when an Sqlite URL is entered via the JDBC
option.</p>
<p>Borg has legacy code to
detect when a Mysql URL is entered and provides support for Mysql
specific issues. However, Mysql is no longer being tested with Borg
and is deprecated.</p>
