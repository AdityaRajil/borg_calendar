<H2>Import/Export to XML</H2>
<P>BORG can
export/import its data to/from XML. The import/export actions can be
found on the month view Action menu. Import/Export provides a good
way to backup your data in human readable/editable form.</P>
<P>The XML format
changed in release 1.7.2 as is no longer compatible with the prior
format.</P>
<P>Users are
strongly encouraged to turn on the automatic backup feature which
exports the entire database to a time-stamped zip file when borg
shuts down.</P>
