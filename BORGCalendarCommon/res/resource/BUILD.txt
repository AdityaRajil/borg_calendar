To build BORG from the source, you need the JAVA SDK 1.4 or later, available from java.sun.com.

As of release 1.4 of BORG, the project has been split into 4 separate pieces:

- Common
- UI
- Model
- DB Utilities


The ant build file (build.xml) is in the ant folder in the Common sub-project.

Building
--------
BORG is built using ant. If you have ant (available at apache.org), then
from command line in the BORGCalendarCommon/ant folder, you can do "ant fulldist".
Below are the various ant targets that might be useful:

- ant regen-help - this will generate the search database for the online help. You only need to do this
if you want to generate the search database. Without this step, the help will be readable, but not searchable.
You need to install JavaHelp (http://java.sun.com/products/javahelp/) and modify the build.xml file with the JavaHelp
path. This target is not executed as part of the fulldist target as it requires the optional JavaHelp package.

- ant fulldist - This will build the BORG jar and zip files in the BORGCalendarCommon/dist directory. 
borg.zip can be unzipped and borg.jar can be run. Running this target alone is sufficient to build the program.

- ant installer - This will create the IzPack installers for BORG in the Common/dist folder. Both the source and non-source
versions are created. The IzPack software is required (http://www.izforge.com/izpack) and the build.xml file must be
updated with the path to this software. 

Eclipse
-------
BORG development is done using the Eclipse IDE. As BORG has grown larger, it has become
mainly an eclipse based project. It's getting a bit big to manage without an IDE.
To use eclipse, you must import the 4 parts of BORG as projects. 

When the 4 parts of BORG are imported into the eclipse IDE as projects, eclipse will enforce
the dependencies (or rather lack of dependencies) between them. The eclipse projects are
set up to enforce that Common depends on no other part of BORG, while Model only depends
on Common. UI depends on Common and Model, and will not depend on a new Web-based UI that may
be added in the future.

To use eclipse, each of the top 4 project folders must be imported as a project into eclipse.
The .project and .classpath files that configure eclipse are part of the source tree and should get the 4 projects
all set up correctly. To build, you can set up an Ant Build task under the eclipse exteral
tools. 

You should be able to use the eclipse debugger to debug the code. You should be able to run the main
Borg class (Borg Calendar UI/src/net/sf.borg.control.Borg) from within eclipse. 

The GUI screens are edited using the eclipse visual editor plugin. You do not need to use this to edit the GUI screens,
but it helps.

NetBeans
--------
Netbeans is not used anymore. I would not suggest using it for BORG.
