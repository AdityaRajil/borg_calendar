To build BORG from the source, you need the JAVA SDK 1.4 or later, available from java.sun.com.
You only need to build BORG if you want to modify it. Otherwise, the binary
jar file - borg.jar - will run on ANY OS that has the Java runtime 1.4.

BORG was built using ant. If you have ant (available at apache.org), then
from command line in the ant folder, do - "ant fulldist". This will build the BORG zip files
in the borg_src directory. The jar files are put into the borg_src/dist directory.

If you do not want to use ant and you know your way around Java, it should not take
long to figure out how to build it your own way. However, using ant is much much easier.

The BORG screens were created using NetBeans. NetBeans is a free Java IDE
available from netbeans.org. It contains a GUI builder. 

I usually build BORG from within NetBeans, even when not changing screens. It has a nice Java
editor and browser.  If you wish to modify the screens, using NetBeans would make it much easier. 
Otherwise, there is no absolute reason that NetBeans must be used to edit the code. 
However, if you want to modify the screens and incorporate them 
back into the borg-calendar project at sourceforge, you will have to use
netbeans.

To set up BORG in netbeans, mount the borg_src2/src and borg_src2
directories as a filesystem in the Explorer/Filesystems tab. 
You should be able to explore to the borg_src2/ant/build item and click on
it to show the various ant targets. Right-click on fulldist and select execute
to start building. Send me email at i_flem@users.sourceforge.net with any
questions. 

If you want to run BORG from inside Netbeans, using the debugger for example, 
you need to make a copy of the resource folder in the src folder. If you are lucky
enough to be running Linux, you can just put a symbolic link in the src
direcory (from the src directory, do ln -s ../resource . ). From windows, you
must copy the folder. A shortcut is not good enough. I have yet to find a way
around this. I don't like IDEs that try to enforce their own application directory structures
on you. :(
