To build BORG from the source, you need the JAVA SDK 1.4 or later, available from java.sun.com.
You only need to build BORG if you want to modify it. Otherwise, the binary
jar file - borg.jar - will run on ANY OS that has the Java runtime 1.4.

As of release 1.4 of BORG, the project has been split into 4 separate pieces:

- Common
- UI
- Model
- DB Utilities


The ant build file (build.xml) is in the ant folder in the Common sub-project.

BORG is normally built using ant. If you have ant (available at apache.org), then
from command line in the ant folder, do - "ant fulldist". This will build the BORG zip files
in the BORG Calendar Common directory. The jar files are put into the Common/dist directory.

To recreate the search information in the help help jar, you need to have JavaHelp installed and you need to 
edit the build.xml file with the path to JavaHelp. The regen-help target in the build.xml file will build the search data.

Eclipse
-------
Most BORG development is done using the Eclipse IDE. As BORG has grown larger, it has become
mainly an eclipse based project. It's getting a bit big to manage without an IDE.
To use eclipse, you must import the 4 parts of BORG as projects. 

When the 4 parts of BORG are imported into the eclipse IDE as projects, eclipse will enforce
the dependencies (or rather lack of dependencies) between them. The eclipse projects are
set up to enforce that Common depends on no other part of BORG, while Model only depends
on Common. UI depends on Common and Model, and will not depend on a new Web-based UI that may
be added in the future.

To use eclipse, each of the top 4 project folders must be imported as a project into eclipse.
The .project and .classpath files that configure eclipse are part of the source tree and should get the 4 projects
all set up correctly. To build, you need to set up an Ant Build task under the eclipse exteral
tools. You need to build the clean-build target if you just want borg.jar. You can build the fulldist target
to get the ZIP files (binary and source). The built files will be in BORG Calendar/Common/dist.

You should be able to use the eclipse debugger to debug the code. You should be able to run the main
Borg class (Borg Calendar UI/src/net/sf.borg.control.Borg) from within eclipse. 

The GUI screens are edited using the eclipse visual editor plugin. You do not need to use this to edit the GUI screens,
but it helps.

NetBeans
--------
Netbeans is not used anymore. I would not suggest using it for BORG.
