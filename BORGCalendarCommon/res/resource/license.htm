LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License.&nbsp; The &quot;Program&quot;,
below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&nbsp; Each licensee is addressed as
&quot;you&quot;.<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
notices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you changed the files and the date of any
change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
that in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all
third<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If the modified program normally reads commands
interactively<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
provide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program
under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of
this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License.&nbsp; (Exception: if the Program itself is
interactive but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not normally print such an announcement, your work
based on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
&nbsp;<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange; or,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least
three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than
your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost of physically performing source distribution, a
complete<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to
be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the
offer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to distribute corresponding source code.&nbsp; (This
alternative is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received the program in object code or executable form with
such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.&nbsp; For an executable work, complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable.&nbsp; However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the General Public License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any<br>
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO
WARRANTY<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED<br>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE<br>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND
CONDITIONS<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New
Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is
safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of
what it does.&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software; you can redistribute it
and/or modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
published by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the
License, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
useful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty
of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp;
See the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public
License<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston,
MA&nbsp; 02111-1307&nbsp; USA<br>
<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, the commands you use may<br>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if<br>
necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>
&nbsp; `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<br>
&nbsp; Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>
<br>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br>
Public License instead of this License.<br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
