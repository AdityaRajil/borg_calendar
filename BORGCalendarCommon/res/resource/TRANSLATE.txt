BORG TRANSLATION HOW-TO
-----------------------

This file describes how to translate the text strings in BORG to
a new language.

To change the text strings in BORG, you have to understand a little
about the borg.jar file. A jar (Java archive) file is just a regular ZIP archive with
some extra java related items in it. The borg.jar file can be unzipped
using any tool that works on ZIP files, or using the jar tool that
comes with the Java SDK.

If you unzip the borg.jar file, you will find that it contains a number
of folders - com, net, META-INF, and resource. All of the files containing
the BORG text strings are in the resource folder. By editing files
in the resource folder and then re-zipping the borg.jar file, you can
change the strings shown by the GUI.

There are 3 different categories of text strings shown in BORG:

1. Strings that come from the Java Runtime
------------------------------------------
These are the Month and Day names. These strings always
appear in the language associated with the locale that is
set in the Appearance tab of the preferences window.
Nothing has to be done to translate these strings.
Just set a new locale, restart BORG, and you should see
translated month and day names.


2. Strings that come from Resource Bundles
------------------------------------------
These include all of the GUI labels, table headers, button text, and menu text
except for the month and day names. These come from a resource bundle called
borg_resource. Resource bundles are a standard way that Java uses to find properties
for a given locale.

When you set a locale in BORG, you are setting 2 data items used by Java - the country
and language. Java has a 2 character code for each of these. 
These codes can be found here: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/intl/locale.doc.html

When BORG needs to display a text string, it first looks for the string in a file called
borg_resource_ll_cc.properties, where ll is the language and cc is the country code.
For example, the file borg_resource_fe_CA is used first if the locale is set to French/Canada.
If the given property is not found in the file, or the file does not exist, BORG will look
for a file of the form borg_resource_ll.properties. Finally, the default file,
borg_resource.properties is used. This default file is guaranteed to have all of the required
strings. This search algorithm is standard for Java.

The resource files included with BORG are:
borg_resource.properties - for english
borg_resource_es.properties - default for all spanish locales
borg_resource_de.properties - default for all german locales (release 1.3.2)

*** To create a new translation: *** 

1. unzip borg.jar
2. go to the resource folder. make a copy of borg_resources.properties and name it according to the locale you will use.
3. For each string, replace the value on the right side of the equals (=) with the translated
string. Do not touch the value to the left of the equals.
4. re-zip borg.jar

*** To change an existing translation: ***
1. unzip borg.jar
2. edit the resource file that you want to change
3. re-zip the file

If you use Java web start, I am not sure where the borg.jar file is kept, nor if it is ok
to edit it. So download the borg ZIP file from sourceforge if you want to change
the text strings.

3. Strings that come from regular text or html files inside borg.jar
--------------------------------------------------------------------
These include the Help text, README, License, and CHANGES text.
These come from regular text or html files in the resource directory.
There is currently no support in BORG to show different versions of these
files based on locale. If you want to change them, just edit them.
If someone were to send me a translation of these files, I'd figure out a way
to switch them based on locale.

in the next release, email it to me at i_flem@users.sourceforge.net

So far, I have gotten files from:
