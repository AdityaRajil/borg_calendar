BORG is a calendar/task tracking program written in JAVA.
It is known to run on Windows, Sun, HP-UX, Linux, OS/2, MAC. 
It should run on any OS that has a working Java JRE.

Please visit http://borg-calendar.sourceforge.net for information.

INSTALL
-------
Unzip the borg_xxx.zip file into a folder.
That's it. No menu items or shortcuts are set up automatically.

RUNNING
-------
** WINDOWS QUICK START ** - Double-click borg.jar from windows explorer.
If you have Java installed, the program should run. This should work out-of-the-box with windows XP.
If you are running another OS or it doesn't work, keep reading.

*** Windows users: to get the windows systray icon working - see SYSTRAY.txt ***

To run BORG, you need to have the Java runtime (JRE) 1.4 or later.
If you don't have this, you can get this from java.sun.com. 

The quickest way to run BORG from a command line is

java -jar borg.jar

This will work as long as the java program from the JRE is in your PATH
on whatever OS you are running. For windows, use javaw instead of java to eliminate the extra
console window that appears.

windows - From windows explorer, double-clicking on borg.jar might start it. This depends on if you have .jar files associated with the 
javaw.exe program that comes with the JRE. If windows asks for a program to run it with - specify javaw.exe from the JRE bin.

UNINSTALL
---------
There is no true "uninstall". Just delete the files that came in borg.zip. You can also delete your database files. 
There is nothing else to remove.

LOOK AND FEEL
-------------
The default look and feel is the Metal look and feel that comes with Java. This can be changed by choosing
a new look and feel from the options screen and then restarting the program. I would suggest the windows
look and feel for XP users. I would suggest the PlasticXP look and feel for everyone else. The PlasticXP look
and feel is bundled with BORG as of release 1.4.
