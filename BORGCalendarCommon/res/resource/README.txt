BORG is a calendar/task tracking program written in JAVA.

Please visit http://borg-calendar.sourceforge.net for information.

-------------------------------------------------------
If you are in a hurry and just want to run it ASAP,
then you at least need to have the Java runtime (JRE) 1.4 or later.
You can get this from java.sun.com.

The quickest way to run BORG is

java -jar borg.jar

This will work as long as the java program from the JRE is in your PATH
on whatever OS you are running.

From windows explorer, double-clicking on borg.jar might start it. This depends on if you have .jar files associated with the javaw.exe program that comes with the JRE. If windows asks for a program to run it with - specify javaw.exe from the JRE bin.

BORG is open source. A copy of the GPL is included with it.

Source is available from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/borg-calendar/

INSTALL
-------
There is no install (except for installing the JRE if needed)
The borg.jar file can be run from anywhere. So put it where you like.
*** Windows users: to get the windows systray icon working - see SYSTRAY.txt ***

UNINSTALL
---------
There is no true "uninstall". Just delete the files that came in borg.zip. You can also delete your database files - borg.jdb and mrdb.jdb. There is nothing else to remove.
