iCal Import/Export


BORG can use the ical4j library (ical4j.sourceforge.net) to export/import Appointment data in iCal format.


LIMITATIONS
-----------

Every iCal based program seems to pick and choose which elements of iCal format they want to use and which way they interpret them. Different programs also seem to use  non-standard amounts of whitespace. The ical4j libraries used by BORG seem to adhere strictly to the iCal standard and cannot parse iCal files from some other programs that don't follow the standard exactly.

The iCal files produced by BORG have been tested with phpicalendar and outlook. (and a little with Mozilla Calendar,  which has serious performance problems when importing my 4000 appointments).

Not every feature in BORG corresponds to something that other iCal
based calendars will understand and vice versa.

The following are things in BORG that do not export:
·	Repeat by Monthly(day), weekdays, weekends, MWF, T-Th will not export correctly at this time. All other repeat options are exported correctly. This just hasn’t been coded yet.
·	Tasks from the task tracker are not exported. They do not correspond to iCal items.
·	Address book information is not exported. It does not correspond to iCal items.
·	Appt occurrences in a repeating sequence that are marked as deleted using Delete-One-Only will appear as not-deleted when exported.
·	The information about which occurrences of a repeating todo have been completed will not be exported at this time. I am not sure if iCal even supports this concept.

There are also items from other programs that will be ignored on import. For example, iCal data concerning meeting participants is ignored. There is simply no corresponding functionality in BORG. 

Most of the above are limited because the iCal programs (like Mozilla Calendar and phpicalendar) do not have corresponding functionality. In many cases, the programs have equal but different functionality.

As you try to use the exported iCal data, feel free to log bugs or feature requests in the project trackers. I have only limited ways to test this, and I expect that once users try things out with other programs, like Ximian and Apple iCal, more issues will become apparent. 
  
** CAUTION **
-------------
Currently, BORG does not keep imported appointments separate from manually entered ones. So, if you import a calendar containing a load of appointments, you cannot easily delete them all if you find that don't want them. Some calendars keep imported or "shared" calendar information separate and allow you do simply delete an entire imported calendar if you don't want it any longer.
BORG cannot do this yet.
