BORG can use the ical4j library (ical4j.sourceforge.net) to export Appointment data to iCal
format.


LIMITATIONS
-----------

Every iCal based program seems to pick and choose which elements of iCal format they want to use
and which way they interpret them. Different programs also seem to use non-standard amounts
of whitespace. 

The iCal files produced by BORG have been tested with phpicalendar and outlook. (and a little with Mozilla Calendar, which
has problems).

Not every feature in BORG corresponds to something in iCal format that other iCal
based calendars will understand.

The following are limitations:
1. Repeat by Monthly(day), weekdays, and weekends will not export correctly. All other repeat options are exported correctly
2. Tasks from the task tracker are not exported
3. Address book information is not exported
4. Built-in US and Canadian Holidays are not exported
5. Appt occurrences in a repeating sequence that are marked as deleted using Delete-One-Only will appear as not-deleted when exported.
6. Appts marked as Todo's can be exported as a VToDo or a VEvent, not both. This is a new option on the misc option tab. In iCal based programs, VToDo's usually
appear in a task list and NOT in the calendar itself. VEvents appear in the calendar, but not on the task list.
I suggest setting the option to export them as VEvents. In addition, the information about which occurrences of a 
repeating todo have been completed will not be exported.

Most of the above are limited because the iCal programs (like Mozilla Calendar and phpicalendar) do not have
corresponding functionality.

As you try to use the exported iCal data, feel free to log bugs or feature requests in the project trackers.
I have only limited ways to test this, and I expect that once users try things out with other programs,
like Ximian and Apple iCal, more issues will become apparent.
