BORG is a calendar/task tracking program written in JAVA.
It is known to run on Windows, Sun, HP-UX, Linux, OS/2, MAC. 
It should run on any OS that has a working Java JRE.

Please visit http://borg-calendar.sourceforge.net for information.

RUNNING
-------
** WINDOWS ** 
The installer should create shortcuts in the start menu and desktop (optional)

Otherwise, double-click borg.jar from windows explorer.
It is found in the folder you choose from this installer.

** Non-Windows **
The quickest way to run BORG from a command line is
java -jar borg.jar

This will work as long as the java program from the JRE is in your PATH
on whatever OS you are running. 

LOOK AND FEEL
-------------
The default look and feel is the Metal look and feel that comes with Java. This can be changed by choosing
a new look and feel from the options screen and then restarting the program. I would suggest the windows
look and feel for XP users. I would suggest the PlasticXP look and feel for everyone else. The PlasticXP look
and feel is bundled with BORG as of release 1.4.
