RELEASE NOTES for BORG 1.4
==========================

The project home page is http://borg-calendar.sourceforge.net

KNOWN ISSUES:
-------------

*** 1. Any options you have set in release 1.3.2 or earlier will be reset in 
release 1.4 as the program will be storing its options in a slightly different 
location. You must re-select your database folder (just choose the same one). 
Don't forget to set the email parameters if you use the email reminder feature.

2. The default method of launching the appointment editor has changed from 
pressing the date buttons to mouse clicking the text box. This change has 
been requested and actually makes the launching of the day and week views 
consistent. However, if you don't like this behavior, it can be changed 
from the miscellaneous options screen.

3. There will be new text strings in 1.4 that have not been translated into 
Spanish. Feel free to mail any translations to 
i_flem@users.sourceforge.net. There is also a new Italian translation.

4. It is known that some screens in the new help system contain formatting 
that has slight imperfections under Java 1.4.2, but not Java 5.0.

5. The iCal import/export has some limitations. Please see the help for 
more information. Please report all problems/issues on the project 
forums or bug tracker. It may be a good idea to test iCal imports on
an alternate database.

6. Information on a number of items that used to be in text files (RDBMS, iCal, SYSTRAY...) 
has been moved to the online help. Check the help pages for this information.


RUNNING
-------
For Windows: The installer can create shortcuts in the start menu and 
desktop (optional)
   Otherwise, double-click borg.jar from windows explorer.
   It is found in the install folder that you choose from the installer.

Command Line (any OS): The quickest way to run BORG from a command line 
is: java -jar borg.jar
   This will work as long as the java executable from the JRE is in your PATH
   on whatever OS you are running. 


LOOK AND FEEL
-------------
The default look and feel is the Metal look and feel that comes with Java. 
This can be changed by choosing a new look and feel from the options screen. 
I would suggest the windows look and feel for XP users. I would suggest 
the PlasticXP look and feel for everyone else. The PlasticXP look and feel 
is bundled with BORG as of release 1.4. The default Metal look and feel 
will actually look quite nice if you are running Java 5.0.


LICENSE

BORG is open source under the GPL. A copy of the GPL is included with it.
Source is available from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/borg-calendar/
If a less restrictive license is desired, send mail to
