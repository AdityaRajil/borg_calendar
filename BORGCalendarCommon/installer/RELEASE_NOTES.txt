============================

The project home page is http://borg-calendar.sourceforge.net

***************************************************************
*** MYSQL Users - database changes are required - See below ***
*************************************************************** 

KNOWN ISSUES:
-------------

1. There WILL be new text strings that have not been translated. 
Feel free to mail any translations to i_flem@users.sourceforge.net.

2. It is known that some screens in the help system contain formatting 
that has slight imperfections under Java 1.4.2, but not Java 5.0.

3. The HELP documentation has not been updated to reflect the changes in release
1.5.1.

MySQL Users
-----------
This section only concerns users using MySQL to store BORG data. The overwhelming majority of
users do not use MySQL. If you are unsure - then you are not using it.

The SQL needed to transition from 1.5 to 1.5.1 is in file update151.sql.

There are MySQL database changes for users migrating from BORG 1.4.x to BORG 1.5.
You must run the SQL in file update1_5.sql to upgrade a 1.4.x database to 1.5 before 
running update151.sql to get to 1.5.1. 

The borg.sql file has been updated with the SQL to create a new 1.5.1 database.
The SQL files are not installed by default and are
installed as part of the optional RDBMS support. 


RUNNING
-------
For Windows: The installer can create shortcuts in the start menu and 
desktop (optional)
   Otherwise, double-click borg.jar from windows explorer.
   It is found in the install folder that you choose from the installer.

Command Line (any OS): The quickest way to run BORG from a command line 
is: java -jar borg.jar
   This will work as long as the java executable from the JRE is in your PATH
   on whatever OS you are running.

BORG is open source under the GPL. A copy of the GPL is included with it.
Source is available from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/borg-calendar/
If a less restrictive license is desired, send mail to 
i_flem@users.sourceforge.net.

DONATIONS
