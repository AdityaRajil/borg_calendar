KNOWN ISSUES:
-------------

1. There WILL be new text strings that have not been translated. 
Feel free to mail any translations to i_flem@users.sourceforge.net.
There is nobody on the project actively updating the translations. Any
received translations will be posted as patches.

2. The HELP documentation has not been updated to reflect all of the changes in release
1.5.1.

MySQL Users
-----------
This section only concerns users using MySQL to store BORG data. 

The SQL needed to transition from 1.5 to 1.5.1 is in file update151.sql.

There are MySQL database changes for users migrating from BORG 1.4.x to BORG 1.5.
You must run the SQL in file update1_5.sql to upgrade a 1.4.x database to 1.5 before 
running update151.sql to get to 1.5.1. 

The borg.sql file has been updated with the SQL to create a new 1.5.1 database.
The SQL files are not installed by default and are
installed as part of the optional RDBMS support. 


RUNNING
-------
For Windows: The installer can create shortcuts in the start menu and 
desktop (optional)
   Otherwise, double-click borg.jar from windows explorer.
   It is found in the install folder that you choose from the installer.

Command Line (any OS): The quickest way to run BORG from a command line 
is: java -jar borg.jar
   This will work as long as the java executable from the JRE is in your PATH
   on whatever OS you are running.
