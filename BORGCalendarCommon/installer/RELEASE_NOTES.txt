============================
RELEASE NOTES for BORG 1.5.1
============================

The project home page is http://borg-calendar.sourceforge.net

KNOWN ISSUES:
-------------

1. There may be new text strings that have not been translated. 
Feel free to mail any translations to i_flem@users.sourceforge.net.

2. It is known that some screens in the help system contain formatting 
that has slight imperfections under Java 1.4.2, but not Java 5.0.

MySQL Users
-----------
This section only concerns users using MySQL to store BORG data. The overwhelming majority of
users do not use MySQL. If you are unsure - then you are not using it.

There are MySQL database changes for users migrating from BORG 1.4.x to BORG 1.5.x
You must run the SQL in file update1_5.sql to upgrade a 1.4.x database to 1.5.x
The borg.sql file has been updated with the SQL to create a new 1.5.x database.
Both the update1_5.sql and borg.sql files are not installed by default and are
installed as part of the optional RDBMS support. 

FYI
---

BORG can now prefix todo's in the main calendar window with animated GIFs.
The program only comes with one animated GIF at this time. From the user color scheme
options tab, there is an option to mark a todo with a character prefix. If you turn on
this option and enter the string: redball.gif as the prefix, an animated red ball with prefix all todo
items. This is the default, but users that have set another prefix in an earlier release must manually
change this.

RUNNING
-------
For Windows: The installer can create shortcuts in the start menu and 
desktop (optional)
   Otherwise, double-click borg.jar from windows explorer.
   It is found in the install folder that you choose from the installer.

Command Line (any OS): The quickest way to run BORG from a command line 
is: java -jar borg.jar
   This will work as long as the java executable from the JRE is in your PATH
   on whatever OS you are running.
