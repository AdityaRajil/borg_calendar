DATABASE CHANGES
----------------

There are significant database changes in BORG 1.6. Scripts to upgrade from 1.5.2 are not
available. Upgrade must be through Export/Import.

Upgrade for MySQL and HSQLDB users
----------------------------------

1. Backup your database
2. Export your database to XML files via the Import/Export menu option
3. MySQL users - Create a new database using the borg_mysql.sql SQL and set BORG to use this
   empty 1.6 database. Restart BORG.
   HSQLDB users - change BORG to use a new folder for its database. Restart BORG to create a
   new 1.6 database in this new folder.
4. Import your database data from the XML files (borg.xml, mrdb.xml, addr.xml).

Upgrade for Local Files Users
-----------------------------
It is recommended that all Local Files users switch to HSQLDB. The Local Files will still work in BORG
1.6, but the new task tracker features (projects, subtasks) and the new memos features will not
work with Local Files.

1. Backup your database
2. Export your database to XML files via the Import/Export menu option
3. change BORG to use HSQLDB as its database and select a new folder for the database. 
   Restart BORG to create a new 1.6 HSQLDB database in this new folder.
4. Import your database data from the XML files (borg.xml, mrdb.xml, addr.xml).


KNOWN ISSUES:
-------------

1. There WILL be many new text strings that have not been translated. 
Feel free to mail any translations to i_flem@users.sourceforge.net.
There is nobody on the project actively updating the translations. Any
received translations will be posted as patches.

2. MySQL and HSQLDB users must migrate to a new database schema via Import/Export

3. The new Subtask features of the task tracker are not available for users of the local db files.
All users are encouraged to switch to MySQL or HSQLDB.

4. The Task Priority field is an integer (1-5) in BORG 1.6. Values from an old database that are not
   an integer between 1 and 5 will be converted to 3.

RUNNING
-------
For Windows: The installer can create shortcuts in the start menu and 
desktop (optional)

   It is found in the install folder that you choose from the installer.

Command Line (any OS): The quickest way to run BORG from a command line 
is: java -jar borg.jar
