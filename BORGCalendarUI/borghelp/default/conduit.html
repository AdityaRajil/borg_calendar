	<h1>BORG Palm Conduits</h1>
	<h2>Status: Experimental</h2>
	Conduits are available to sync the BORG appointment database to the 
	Palm datebook and todo applications. These conduits replace the existing
	Palm conduits - Palm OS does not allow Palm apps to sync to 2 places. In other words,
	if you install the BORG conduits, then Palm will no longer sync with 
	Palm Desktop for datebook and todos.
	<p>
	These conduits are to be considered experimental (alpha quality) for
	2 reasons:
	<nl>
	<li>They have only been tested on Palm OS 5.2 with datebook version 4.5.
	It is likely that other versions of the Palm software will be problematic.</li>
	<li>The BORG and Palm applications do not match in functionality and
	database structure.</li>
	</nl>
	<p>
	I've been syncing my Palm-based Garmin iQue 3600 PDA since January 2005.
	I have well over 4000 appointments, and everything seems ok based on the way I
	use BORG and Palm. However, due to variations in the Palm software and hardware,
	I expect there to still be problems. So, only people willing to be alpha testers
	need read on.
 	<h2>Required Software</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Windows</li>
		<li>BORG 1.5 or later using local files (MySQL NOT Supported for syncing)</li>
		<li>Palm OS 5 (only 5.2 tested)</li>
		<li>Palm JSync Suite</li>
		<li>Java Conduit Manager (www.javaconduitmanager.org) or 
		alternative conduit installer</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	The conduits are pure java and if there is a Linux port of JSync, then they should work. However, I 
	don't know anything at all about the Palm environment under Linux.
	<h2>Who should use this</h2>
	At this stage, I suggest only users who use BORG as their primary calendar should proceed ahead. If you
	use Palm Desktop and like it, then these conduits are not for you. If you just are curious about BORG
	and just want to try out the conduits, but plan to switch back to Palm Desktop - run away now. The
	Palm environment is not that user friendly when it comes to conduits, and backing out the BORG conduits
	may be more complex than installing them. So, if you are not comfortable with the steps you read below, then
	forget it for now and let others test out the initial versions.
	<h2>Warnings and Limitations</h2>
	The functionality of BORG and Palm do not match - just like Outlook and Palm do not match.
	At this time, if you try to use a recurrence option in Palm that is not supported by BORG, the resulting
	BORG appointment will repeat incorrectly. The same is true if you use a BORG recurrence option that Palm
	does not support (i.e. repeat every N days).
	<p>
	There is some BORG data that has no corresponding field in the Palm databases. For example - vacation, 
	holiday, category, color - (my version of datebook does not support these). This data will be stored on the
	Palm in the Notes field. Therefore, you cannot use the Notes field in the datebook and todo once you start syncing
	with BORG.
	<h2>Installation Steps</h2>
	<nl>
	<li> Install BORG Release 1.5 (or later) including the optional conduits. </li>
	The conduits will be placed in the "conduits" directory under the BORG install directory.
	<li> Unless you already have software capable of installing Java conduits (you'd probably know if you did),
	you should download and install the Java Conduit Manager software from 
	http://www.javaconduitmanager.org/downloads.htm
	Download the larger version that comes bundled with the Palm JSync software. You can download the smaller
	version only if you already have the JSync software installed. Again, you'd know if you have this installed,
	it does not come with your Palm software.</li>
	<li>
	Backup your Palm datebook and todo databases. I am not sure of all of the ways to do this. The datebook can be exported
	from Palm Desktop. The best way might be to make backup copies of the Palm datebook and todo folders under
	C:\Program Files\Palm\<i>your_palm_user_name</i></li>
	<br>
	<li>*** Now we reach a possible point of no return. To install the conduits, start the Java Conduit Manager and select the 
	option to add a conduit. When asked to select a file, browse to the BORG appointment conduit (default location
	would be: C:\Program Files\BORG Calendar\conduits\apptconduit.jar). This will remove your existing datebook
	conduit and install the BORG conduit. The Java Conduit Manager should store information required for
	restoring the original Palm datebook conduit - but I have seen it mess up at least once. I believe there
	is a way to restore the original Palm conduits from your Palm software installation CD - but how do to this
	may differ depending on your Palm device.
	You should also use Java Conduit Manager to install the todo conduit (todoconduit.jar).
	*** just to be clear - once you perform this step, you will no longer be able to sync with Palm Desktop
	unless you back out the BORG conduits. Hopefully, Java Conduit Manager can do this without you needing to re-install
	Palm Desktop - but I've seen this mess up.
	<p>
	*** do not install the address conduit. There is too much different between the BORG and Palm address databases
	for me to suggest that people use it at this time. If you ONLY use the BORG address fields and stay away from
	certain Palm address fields, it may be acceptable to you. Otherwise, forget it.</li>
	<li>Make a new folder called borg under your Palm user folder (default would be:
	C:\Program Files\Palm\<i>your_palm_user_name</i>\borg. Then copy your BORG database files there if you have any.
	The BORG conduits can only sync if your database files are in this folder.</li>
	<li>Start BORG and change the database location to C:\Program Files\Palm\<i>your_palm_user_name</i>\borg.</li>
	<li>Select the new option on the miscellaneous options tab to support Palm Hot-Sync and restart BORG. Turning on this
	option and doing a restart is very important to prevent data from being lost during a hot-sync.</li>
	</nl>
	<h2>Syncing for the First Time</h2>
	First, syncing can only be done when BORG is not running, so stop BORG. 
	<p>
	Then for the first sync, it is best have BORG completely WIPE and REPLACE your Palm data. To do this,
	go to the Custom menu option of the Palm Hot-Sync Manager. 
	Select the BORG Appointment Conduit and hit the Change button. Select the option where BORG WIPES and Overwrites
	the handheld. Do NOT select the default checkbox.
	Of course, if you have Palm data that is not in BORG, then don't do this.
	<p>
	If you have an empty BORG database and want to transfer from the Palm to BORG, do not change the the type of
	sync.
	<p>
	If you have data in both Palm and BORG - the conduits cannot tell that it is the same (I assume you'd have the
	same appointments entered in each). You are likely to wind up with a big mess of duplicate data if you sync without
	either emptying one or the other.
	<p>
	Hot sync your palm. After the sync is done, check the results. The Palm and BORG todo lists should match. The
	Palm datebook and BORG Calendar should match.
	<p>
	If something has gone wrong, then you can check the hot-sync log (View Log menu option in Hot-Sync Manager).
	<p> You should be able to back out the BORG conduits using Java Conduit Manager.
	<h2>Alarms</h2>
	In BORG 1.5, there is a new appointment option checkbox labelled "Alarm". This option does nothing at all in BORG.
	However, if you check this, then the appointment will have its alarm set in the Palm datebook when you sync to the Palm.
