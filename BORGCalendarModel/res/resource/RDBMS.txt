At this point, only a single user is supported per DB, although multiple DBs can be created.

BORG has ONLY been tested with MYSQL. Instructions here are for MYSQL only

Some familiarity with MYSQL is assumed in the instructions below.

To use RDBMS support with MYSQL:
--------------------------------

1. Install MYSQL and make it accessible on your machine or network. See www.mysql.com
   for the software (which is free).

2. Create a database for BORG data in MYSQL. Name it whatever you like.

3. Create a user with at least select/insert/update/delete access to your database 

4. Create the BORG database tables in your database. This is done by running the SQL contained
   in the borg.sql file that comes with BORG. How you run this depends on what tools
   you are using. From the mysql command line you would do this:

mysql>use your-database-name
mysql>source borg.sql               <=== you need the full path to borg.sql if it is not
                                         in your current folder.

5. BORG looks for a database driver for MYSQL in the CLASSPATH. The driver
   is ** NOT ** shipped with BORG. You have to download this separately.
   BORG 1.3 was tested with MYSQL Connector/J from www.mysql.com/products/connector-j/index.html
   To use this, download the latest stable version. Included should be a jar file called
   something like: mysql-connector-java-3.0.11-stable-bin.jar. The easiest way to get this
   file in the CLASSPATH is to just copy it to the lib/ext folder under where the JAVA Runtime
   is installed.

6. Run BORG and set the MySQL database parameters from the database options screen.

7. You can transfer data from BORG data files by exporting the data to XML, switching
   your URL to the new empty DB URL, and then importing the data from XML.

So, why use RDBMS???? I am not sure. It is much more complicated and requires more
administration. I would imagine that some users are comfortable with setting up
MYSQL and might want to take advantage of the fact that once the data is in an RDBMS, 
ad-hoc data access is easy through SQL. An RDBMS also provides a path forward to allowing
multi-user access or even a web interface in the future.

MYSQL can also be run remotely!!
